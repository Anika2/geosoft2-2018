# Geosoftware II at ifgi - WiSe 2018/19

**Enhancing discovery of geospatial datasets in data repositories**

Teachers: [@nuest](https://github.com/nuest/), [@edzer](http://github.com/edzer/)

## Initial training resources

Handouts for background technical presentations for Geosoftware II at ifgi.
These handouts are the core of the preparation of a topic.
It should be prepared in a manner so that fellow students can use it as a starting point for making decisions during their project work.

### Process

1. Fork this project
1. Do your research
1. Create a folder for your topic (topic-title-no-capitals-with-hypens)
1. Add a file `handout.md` file in your folder
    * Take a look at the [markdown syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
    * Split up your work into logical sections and use informative names for each of these
1. Create a presentation based on your handout (optinal: add it to your folder)
2. Add and push a tag `handout-submission-<name>` in your fork
1. Send a pull request before the submission deadline containing your handout (not the presentation)
    * Give the pull request a useful name and description
    * Implement the feedback by the lecturers
    * Update the pull request by pushing the changes to your repository
1. Present at the seminar
2. Incorporate feedback from the presentation into the handout
1. If you see an error or want to extend information of your own on a colleague's handout...
    1. Update your fork (fetch and merge)
    1. Make the changes
    1. Send a pull request to the original author of the topic and present your changes

### Evaluation

The evaluation is conducted based on the content of the handout, the presentation itself, and the discussion afterwards during the course.
Be prepared for questions by your fellow students and the teachers, but also prepare some additional content or questions yourself so that you can stick to (= fill up completely) your presentation time slot.

### Topics

Make sure you cover at least the mentioned keywords.
More is better, but only really better if you evaluate alternatives, phrase opinions, and provide guidelines for your fellow students.

- scholarly publishing: history and future
- academic search engines
- data publishing requirements in science
- research data lifecycle & best practices
- geospatial data formats & libraries
- time series data formats & libraries
- FOSS repositories & preservation
- publication metadata
- Geodata catalogues & geospatial metadata
- metadata extraction
- spatial similarity calculation
- agile software development
